## Description
This challange I made my own portfolio website where I can upload current and future projects. I learned how to implement flex to create my containers for all my projects. I had some trouble getting box one to be the biggest container out of all of them. I was able to accomplish this by learning more about flex and seeing what happens when I remove or add flex to certain attributes and elements. Using the Google Developer tool this made it easier to see the changes.
